# An assignment to create an asynchronous search using Javascript and the Pixabay API.

This assignment asks you to accept a query from the user and use that query to search Pixabay in order to show a grid of images that were returned. You are provided with an index.html file that provides a minimal interface for your work. The page also pulls in Axios and Bootstrap for you, so those are at your disposal.

Utilizing principles of progressive enhancement, you must activate the form so you may capture the input from the user and send it along to Pixabay by making a call to the Pixabay API. 

Upon successful response from the Pixabay API, you will then display a grid of the images that have been found. Use the effect or tool of your choice.

Basic Requirements
To successfully complete this assignment, you must fulfill the following requirements:

Create an event handler that will accept user input through the provided form and turn that input into a request to the Pixabay API.

Display the images returned from the Pixabay API as a grid on the page (or in a suitably appealing arrangement that matches your creative ambition).

Display the title of the image within the image itself.

When users re-do the search, the previous images should be removed, and the new images should fill the same space.

Use this API key: <example>

Use polymorphism in the task

Bonus Requirements
There are many ways you can stretch this assignment:

Add a video search option as well.

Add the number of displayed images.

Add “No hits” page in case of 0 images
